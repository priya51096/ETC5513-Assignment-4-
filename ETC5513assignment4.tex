What is OECD ?

\begin{quote}
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is a group of 34 member countries that discuss and develop economic and social policy. OECD members are democratic countries that support free-market economies
\end{quote}

What is ISCED ?

\begin{quote}
The International Standard Classification of Education is a statistical framework for organizing information on education maintained by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. It is a member of the international family of economic and social classifications of the United Nations.
\end{quote}

\includegraphics{ETC5513assignment4_files/figure-latex/skill-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:skill}Types of Skill}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:skill} talks about the different \textbf{Skill Levels}. It is defined as a function of the complexity and range of tasks and duties to be performed in an occupation into groups that people have across the globe in. Let us understand the different skills. Skill Level 01 typically involve the performance of simple and routine physical or manual task, these task require physical strength and/or endurance. Skill Level 02 typically involve the performance of tasks such as operating machinery and electronic equipments, they should also have the ability to read and write to a certain extend. Skill Level 03 involves the performance of complex technical and practical tasks that require an extensive body of factual, technical and procedural knowledge in a specialized feild, requires high level literacy and numeracy and well developed interpersonal communication skills. The graph here shows that \textbf{Europe} have the highest number of migrants with all these skill levels. \textbf{North America} has very less migrants involved in skill level 01 and most migrants have skill level 02 and level 03. \textbf{South America} have more people with skill level 02 followed by skill level 03 and skill level 01. \textbf{Oceania} has verey few migrants with skill level 01 and people with skill level 02 and skill level 03. Most of the migrants in \textbf{Asia} have skill level 02 and skill level 03. \textbf{Africa} has very migrants with all the skill levels.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513assignment4_files/figure-latex/qual-1.pdf}

\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:qual}, Overqualified indicates whether a worker is highly educated for the job that he is doing in a particular continent with respect to their education attainment he has recieved. Looking at the figure closely, we have seen that, \textbf{North America} has the highest over qualified people, followed by \textbf{Europe}, \textbf{South America}, \textbf{Asia}, \textbf{Africa} and \textbf{Oceania}. Not overqualified here refers to that, most migrants have just the right level of education attainment. We see that the top three continents with the right qualification amongst the migrants are \textbf{Europe}, \textbf{North America} and \textbf{Asia}

\section*{Gender Gap in Migration}

Throughout history, humans have migrated for various reasons that could be classified as economic, social, political, etc. This section focuses on the preferred destination countries for migration as well as the gender difference across age groups in the migrant population in destination countries.

The table \ref{tab:topdestinations} depicts the preferred destinations for migration in the year 2015/16. Historically, the USA have been the most popular destination for migration and has remained the same in the year 2015-16, with the most preferred destinations being the USA, Japan, and Mexico across all ages.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:topdestinations}Top 10 destinations}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lr}
\toprule
Country & migrant\_Count\\
\midrule
\rowcolor{gray!6}  United States of America & 323127504\\
Japan & 127094759\\
\rowcolor{gray!6}  Mexico & 119561904\\
Germany & 82424843\\
\rowcolor{gray!6}  Tunisia & 78741055\\

\rowcolor{gray!6}  Korea & 48141031\\
Spain & 45977782\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Among the international migrants, 50.94 \% are females and 49.06 \% are males. Figure \ref{fig:gendergap} shows the gender gap in each country's migrant population and it is observed that in 2015-16, women constituted more in the migrant population especially in the top preferred destinations like the USA, Japan, etc whereas the gap is relatively low in countries like Belgium, Finland, etc.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513assignment4_files/figure-latex/gendergap-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:gendergap}Gender difference in migrant population in countries}
\end{figure}

In 2015-16, the most number of migrants fell in the age group 25-64, with females being higher in number compared to males in countries like the USA, Mexico, Germany, etc. In countries like Japan, Korea and Spain it can be seen that there is no gender gap in the migrant population of age group 25-64 whereas in countries like Poland and Turkey the number of males is higher than females for the same age group.
Amongst the age group 15-24, there is a relatively low gender difference in the migrant population compared to the other age groups and the trend is uniform in almost all the countries whereas amongst the migrants who are 65 years old and above, the number of females is higher than that of males in the USA, Japan , Italy, etc and Mexico being one of the top destinations for migration, saw an influx of an equal number of males and females aged over 65 in the year 2015-16.

\section*{Limitations}

The Database on Immigrants in OECD Countries (DIOC) 2015/16 provides information on age,duration of stay, labour force status and occupation of the migrants. The limitations of the dataset is as follows,

\begin{enumerate}

   \item Confidentiality and Reliability issues 

Due to confidentiality issues, the place of birth is recorded at the continental level such as Africa, Asia, Europe, etc.instead of the country level in the dataset,therefore the analysis is focused on only the destination countries.Also,there is only limited details available on the important variables like educational qualification and skills. 

   \item Unavailability of data

Unavailability of data on variables like age, skills,occupation ,labour force status and educational qualification proved to be a limitation to the analysis of the dataset.

 \item  Inconsistency of data
 
 The dataset contains inconsistency in data for example the reference population for Switzerland, Luxembourg and New Zealand is 15+ and there is no information on the age group 0-14. Due to this reason and the fact that 0-14 age group belongs to the minor category, the age group 0-14  was not considered for the analysis of gender gap in migrant population.  
 
 \end{enumerate}

\section*{Conclusion}

Migrants have made significant impacts on socio-economic as well as the political sphere of a destination countries. From the analysis on the Database on Immigrants in OECD Countries (DIOC) released by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), we conclude the following,

\begin{enumerate}

\item In the year 2015-16 , 50.94 % of international migrants were female where as 49.06% were male. 

\item People between 25-64 years old migrated more compared to the other age groups in year 2015-16. 

\end{enumerate}

\section* {The Education Level of Australian Residents}

In the past few decades, Australia has acquired many skilled migrants, contributing substantially towards the local economy. \textcite{hawthorne2010valuable} states that by 2007, two thirds of them were former international students recruited in Australia rather than offshore applicants. This transition has also been named as the ``two-step-migration'' by \textcite{hawthorne2010valuable}.

This section will analyse the education levels of current residents of Australia categorized by their duration of stay in the country.

The dataset provides information on the education levels of Australian residents and their duration of stay within the country.\\
The residents of Australia have been categorized based on their duration of stay within the country as\\
- native born\\
- less than 5 years\\
- between 5 - 10 years\\
- more than 10 years\\
The level of education has been categorized using a broad three-category classification as\\
- low\\
- medium\\
- high

However the duration of stay of 25.9\% of Australian residents is unknown, while the education level of 24.6\% residents is unknown. These values will also be used in the analysis as unknowns, to provide a more accurate overlook on the overall numbers.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{ETC5513assignment4_files/figure-latex/tile-plot-edu-vs-duration-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:tile-plot-edu-vs-duration}Breakdown of Australian residents based on their level of Education and duration of stay in Australia}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:tile-plot-edu-vs-duration} shows the breakdown of Australian residents based on their duration of stay in Australia and their level of education; the higher counts of residents are represented by light blue and the lower number of residents are represented by dark blue. The dataset contains a few unknowns about the Australian resident, some on the level of education and some on the duration of stay, which is also represented in figure \ref{fig:tile-plot-edu-vs-duration}.

It's obvious that the highest counts of Australian residents are natives, and is interesting that a majority of them have a medium level of education, followed by natives having a higher level of education and only a few of them having a low level of education.
It's also interesting how the numbers of Ausralian residents who have been in the country for over ten years, shows higher counts of numbers than those who have been in the country for a lower duration of time. It can also be seen that in all three categories of non-native born Australians, most have received a high level of education.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:table-percent-levels-of-education}Percentages of Australian residents with different levels of education over each category of duration of stay}
\centering
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|l|l|l|l}
\hline
Duration of stay & High level of education (\%) & Medium level of education (\%) & Low level of education (\%) & Unknown level of education (\%)\\
\hline
five-to-ten-years & 54\% & 31\% & 9\% & 5\%\\
\hline
five-years-or-less & 50\% & 34\% & 10\% & 6\%\\
\hline
more-than-ten-years & 37\% & 34\% & 21\% & 8\%\\
\hline
native-born & 29\% & 41\% & 22\% & 8\%\\
\hline
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

A breakdown of Australian residents with different durations of stay, into their level of education is represented in table \ref{tab:table-percent-levels-of-education}. It can be seen that the majority of individuals who have obtained residency in Australia recently have a high level of education while only a few of them have a low level of education. A significant increase in percentages of individuals with higher levels of education obtaining residency in Australia can also be seen from table \ref{tab:table-percent-levels-of-education}. Most native-Australians (41\%) have a medium level of education, while others with shorter durations of stay in Australia have much higher levels of education.

\textcite{green2007immigrant} states that the immigration policies in Australia has placed an increased focus in skill-based selection criteria, and has resulted in overeducation of recently arrived Australian immigrants. This can be attributed to the most of the recent immigrants having a high level of education as represented by figure \ref{fig:tile-plot-edu-vs-duration} and table \ref{tab:table-percent-levels-of-education}.
